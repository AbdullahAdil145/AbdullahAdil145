I am a versatile and motivated Full Stack Developer with a strong academic foundation in Computer Science and practical experience developing scalable, web-based applications. My work spans front-end design with modern frameworks like React to back-end development using Node.js and database management with MySQL and MongoDB.
I've contributed to impactful projects, including Chrome extensions that streamline job applications and a full-stack hotel management system with authentication and role-based access. I thrive in collaborative environments, bringing a balance of technical skill, creative problem-solving, and attention to user experience.
My technical stack includes JavaScript, Java, Python, C++, and PHP, alongside tools like Git, Postman, Jira, and Oracle VirtualBox. I'm passionate about continuous learning and applying a user-centered approach to real-world development challenges.
Currently seeking opportunities to contribute to dynamic development teams, where I can build, learn, and deliver value through technology.
